# music-RNN
This project generates music based on Chopin's music using LSTM. 

[Sample audio (click to play)](output/test_output_100.mp4)

## Instruction
1. Clone this repository 
2. Run "music_simple.ipynb"

## Required packages
```
pip install --upgrade music21
pip install tensorflow==2.2
```

## Result
- A trained model "model-chopin_100.h5" in the [model folder](https://github.com/YC-1412/music_RNN/tree/main/models)
- Generated music midi file "test_output_100.mid" and it's pdf in the [output folder](https://github.com/YC-1412/music_RNN/tree/main/output)

## Data
95 midi files of Chopin's music scraped from https://www.midiworld.com/chopin.htm
A processed and cleaned data file `chopin_clean` is uploaded to this repository. The notebook can be run by simply changing the filepath.

## Copyright
Chopin's music is public accessible. Please contact me at: yuricao1412@gmail.com if scraping is not allowed.
